## 💬 About Me
I'm a passionate software developer with broad technical expertise in web development, IT infrastructure, and DevOps practices. I actively develop scalable, secure applications using the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem with a strong focus on user experience.

I specialize in React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and SQL. In addition to frontend and backend development, I have knowledge in CI/CD pipelines, basic test automation, and DevOps workflows. I'm experienced in unit testing, and deployment processes using AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I also work on role-based authentication, API security, and payment system integration. I'm constantly improving my knowledge in Linux and cybersecurity, especially in system hardening and performance optimization.

Always open to learning and driven by analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, I aim to deliver effective, sustainable solutions in every project I contribute to.
